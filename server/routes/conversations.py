"""GET /v1/conversations and friends — persistent conversation records.

Returns Anton-side data only (id, title, turns, preview, timestamps,
project, messages). Cowork-side metadata (pinned, attachments) lives
on the cowork-side routes (/v1/pins, /v1/attachments) and is merged
client-side into the UI "task" object.

Conversations are scoped to a project (folder under projects_store):
  GET /v1/conversations                     → active project
  GET /v1/conversations?project=<name>      → that project
  GET /v1/conversations?project=all         → merged across all projects
  GET /v1/projects/{name}/conversations     → convenience alias

    cycle and attach per-turn event metadata.

    Anton's history often contains MULTIPLE assistant messages between
    two user messages (a brief acknowledgement, then a tool-use phase,
    then the final answer). During live streaming the client only sees
    the final composed assistant turn, but `_history.json` keeps each
    intermediate text response as its own entry. If we surfaced each
    as a separate bubble the conversation would render very differently
    after a reload than during streaming — most visibly, a brief intro
    gets its own bubble, then the actual answer (with thinking +
    artifacts) gets ANOTHER, when they should be one.

    So we merge consecutive assistant text messages into a single
    bubble with content joined by blank lines. The events sidecar lives
    per "displayable turn" (matching `record_turn_events`'s filter), so
    a merged bubble inherits the events of its last segment — which is
    where scratchpad cells and artifacts actually came from.
