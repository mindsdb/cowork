"""Cowork-side endpoints that back the `data-vault-form` workflow.

Form submissions flow through `POST /v1/datavault/submissions`. The
endpoint stages the values in the in-memory submission store and
returns a `submission_id` the cowork frontend uses when sending its
chat continuation back to Anton. Anton's tool then redeems the
submission id for the actual values just-in-time, never letting
credential material round-trip through chat history.

Phase 1 deliberately keeps this endpoint minimal — no validation
yet, no orchestration. The connection-test logic still lives behind
the existing `/v1/datasources/validate` + `/v1/datasources` routes;
the agent reaches them via the existing publisher / connector
tools. We add staging here so the chat continuation can stay free
of secrets.
