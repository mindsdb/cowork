"""Conversation lifecycle manager.

Owns:
  - The in-memory pool of live ChatSession instances (capped, evicted oldest).
  - The "build a ChatSession for this project" recipe that cowork was
    using inside anton_bridge._build_chat_session.
  - On-disk history persistence (delegated to anton.memory.HistoryStore).
  - Conversation metadata (id / title / turns / preview / created_at /
    updated_at / project) persisted alongside history.

The public API is small:
  - chat_stream(input, conversation_id, project, model)        → (stream, id)
  - list_conversations(limit, project)
  - get_conversation(id)
  - get_messages(id)
  - update_conversation(id, **patch)
  - delete_conversation(id)
  - close_all()
  - is_anton_available()

A "project" is a folder name under projects_store.projects_dir(); the actual
filesystem path is resolved internally. Passing project=None means "active
project."

Internally the live cache calls a Python class still named ChatSession
because that's anton-core's name. The API noun is "conversation."

    on the next turn.

    Anthropic enforces TWO matching constraints on tool calls:
      (1) every assistant `tool_use` must be followed by a user
          message containing a `tool_result` with the same id, AND
      (2) every user `tool_result` must be preceded by an assistant
          message whose `tool_use` carries the matching id.

    Both invariants can break. Anton's auto-retry path on stream
    failure appends a "SYSTEM: error" user message right after a
    dangling `tool_use` — violating (1). Anton's history truncation
    can drop the assistant turn that owned a `tool_use` while
    keeping the user turn that carried its `tool_result` — violating
    (2). Either failure surfaces as a 400.

    The sanitizer applies two passes:
      • Pass 1 — scan assistant messages with `tool_use` blocks.
        For any id NOT acknowledged in the next user message, splice
        a synthetic `tool_result` block ("interrupted by user — tool
        call did not complete") into the next user message (or
        insert a new user message right after).
      • Pass 2 — scan user messages with `tool_result` blocks. For
        each block whose `tool_use_id` doesn't match a `tool_use` in
        the *immediately preceding* assistant message, drop that
        block. If a user message ends up with no surviving content,
        drop the message entirely.

    Pass 1 fixes the "tool_use without tool_result" 400.
    Pass 2 fixes the "tool_result without tool_use" 400.

    the caller should write the result back to disk and drop the
